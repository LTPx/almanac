      <h3>Web (almanac.openmind.cx / openmind.cx)</h3>
      <p>
        We use Google's certified Consent Management Platform (CMP) under the

        <li>Personalized ads</li>
        <li>Non-personalized ads</li>
        <li>Reject all advertising cookies</li>

        When consent is denied, we serve non-personalized ads and apply Google
        Consent Mode v2 to adjust analytics and advertising behavior.
