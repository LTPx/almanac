        Welcome to Almanac by Openmind (“Almanac,” “we,” “us”). These Terms
        govern your access to and use of almanac.openmind.cx and our Android/web
        applications (the “Service”). By using the Service you agree to these
        Terms. If you don’t agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Who we are</h2>

        Openmind”)

      <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be 13 or older. The Service is not directed to children. If you
        are under your country’s digital age of consent, you may use the Service
        only with parental or guardian consent.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Your account</h2>
      <p>
        You may sign up with email/password or Google Sign-In. You are
        responsible for activity under your account. Notify us immediately if
        you suspect unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h2>4) Subscriptions, trials, and billing</h2>
      <p>
        We offer free features and optional paid plans, including
        premium_monthly, premium_yearly, and token packs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trials auto-renew unless canceled before they end.</li>
        <li>Android payments use Google Play; Web payments use Stripe.</li>
        <li>Entitlements sync via RevenueCat.</li>
        <li>Manage billing via Google Play or our Stripe portal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may change prices; legally required notice will be provided. Price
        changes apply at your next renewal unless otherwise stated.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Refunds & withdrawal</h2>
      <p>
        Digital content performance begins immediately, which may affect
        withdrawal rights under local consumer law. Mandatory consumer
        protections still apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Android:</strong> refunds follow Google Play policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Web:</strong> refunds follow Stripe and our Refund Policy.
      </p>
      <p>No prorated refunds unless required by law.</p>

      <h2>6) Ads, rewards, and in-app tokens</h2>
      <p>
        Tokens are virtual items, not money or cryptocurrency. They have no
        monetary value, are non-transferable, and cannot be redeemed outside the
        Service. Abuse (automation, spoofing, manipulating ads or reward flows)
        is prohibited and may result in account action.
      </p>

      <h2>7) NFT collectibles (Polygon)</h2>
      <p>
        Completing certain units may mint a non-financial NFT collectible on
        Polygon. Keys are stored locally on your device; we do not control them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may charge in-app tokens for minting.</li>
        <li>Transfers/exports are not yet available.</li>
        <li>Metadata may be off-chain and may be updatable.</li>
        <li>You assume all blockchain-related risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8) Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to break applicable laws, interfere with ads, rewards, or
        NFT systems, scrape, reverse-engineer, disrupt, exploit bugs, or
        automate progress or token accrual.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Intellectual property & license</h2>
      <p>
        We own the Service and its content. You receive a limited, personal,
        revocable, non-commercial license to use the Service. User-generated
        uploads/comments are not currently available.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        We integrate Google AdMob, Google Ad Manager, Google Play Billing,
        Stripe, RevenueCat, analytics tools, hosting providers, and Web3 wallet
        infrastructure. Their terms apply independently.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided “as is” and without warranties, express or
        implied. We do not guarantee accuracy, uptime, availability, or fitness
        for a particular purpose. Nothing in the Service constitutes investment,
        tax, or legal advice.
      </p>

      <h2>12) Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, our maximum liability is the
        higher of €100 or the amount you paid in the previous 12 months. We are
        not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.
        Mandatory consumer law exceptions apply.
      </p>

      <h2>13) Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify us against claims arising from your unlawful
        conduct, misuse of the Service, or breach of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>14) Suspension & termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access for breach, fraud, or compliance with
        legal obligations. You may stop using the Service at any time.
        Provisions that reasonably should survive termination do so.
      </p>

      <h2>15) Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy explains how we process personal data. By using the
        Service you agree to it.
      </p>

      <h2>16) Governing law & venue</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by Spanish law. Exclusive venue is in the
        courts of Illes Balears, unless mandatory consumer protections require
        otherwise.
      </p>

      <h2>17) Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms. Material changes will be communicated when
        required. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
