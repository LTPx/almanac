      <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be 13 or older. The Service is not directed to children. If you
        are under your country’s digital age of consent, you may use the Service

        unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h2>4) Subscriptions, trials, and billing</h2>
      <p>
        We offer free and optional paid plans (premium_monthly, premium_yearly)
        and token packs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trials auto-renew unless canceled before they end.</li>

      </p>

      <h2>5) Refunds & withdrawal</h2>
      <p>
        Digital content performance begins immediately, affecting withdrawal
        rights under local law. Mandatory consumer rights still apply.

      <h2>6) Ads, rewards, and in-app tokens</h2>
      <p>
        Tokens are virtual items, not money or cryptocurrency. They have no
        monetary value and are non-transferable. Abuse (automation, spoofing) is
        prohibited and may result in account action.
      </p>

      <h2>7) NFT collectibles (Polygon)</h2>
      <p>
        Completing certain units may mint a non-financial NFT collectible on
        Polygon. Keys are stored on your device; we do not control them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may charge in-app tokens for minting.</li>
        <li>Transfers/exports not available yet.</li>
        <li>Metadata may be off-chain and updatable.</li>
        <li>You assume all blockchain risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8) Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to break laws, interfere with ads/rewards/NFTs, scrape,
        reverse-engineer, or automate completions or token accrual.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Intellectual property & license</h2>
      <p>
        We own the Service and content. You receive a limited, personal,
        non-commercial license. No uploads/comments available currently.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        We integrate Google AdMob/Ad Manager, Google Play, Stripe, RevenueCat,
        analytics, hosting, and wallet/relayers. Their terms apply
        independently.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided “as is.” No warranty of accuracy or fitness for
        a particular purpose. No investment, tax, or legal advice.
      </p>

      <h2>12) Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        Maximum liability is the higher of €100 or the amount you paid in the
        last 12 months. No indirect or consequential damages. Mandatory
        exceptions apply.
      </p>

      <h2>13) Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify us for claims arising from your unlawful use or
        violation of these Terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate for breach, fraud, or legal compliance. You
        may stop using the Service anytime. Some sections survive termination.
      </p>

      <h2>15) Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy explains how we process personal data. By using the
        Service you accept it.
      </p>

      <h2>16) Governing law & venue</h2>
      <p>
        Spanish law governs these Terms. Courts of Illes Balears have exclusive
        jurisdiction unless mandatory consumer laws apply.
      </p>

      <h2>17) Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms. Material changes will include reasonable
        notice. Continued use after effective date means acceptance.
